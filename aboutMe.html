        <h3><strong>Why I chose this career</strong></h3>
    <p>To be honest, I never thought <em>I'd</em> be the kind of person to become a developer. I‚Äôve always wanted to help people ‚Äî I just didn‚Äôt know how.</p>

<p>One day, I decided I wanted to create a journal app called <strong>"My Daily Digital Journal."</strong> But I had no idea how hard it would be. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but wow... it was frustrating.</p>

<p>As someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, I really wanted something that could help me ‚Äî and since I couldn‚Äôt find it online, I decided to make it myself.</p>

<p>I wanted a journal that could hold thoughts, track emotions, and even offer professional facts and tips to help with mental health.</p>

<p>So, I started searching. That‚Äôs when I stumbled across something called *coding*. I had no idea how to make an app, so I decided to start with a website instead.</p>

<p>The more I learned about coding, the more I fell in love with it. I was problem-solving, building things, using my brain, and had full control over what I created. I <strong>actually</strong> enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Little by little, I started finding free courses. And the more I prayed about it, the more I felt like God was guiding me here. Of course, I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI want to be a full-stack developer‚Äù the first time I saw code üòÖ</p>

<p>It took me almost a year to really figure out what I wanted ‚Äî but even though I haven‚Äôt built that journal app *yet*, I‚Äôm getting closer and closer every day.</p>

<p>I truly believe this calling is from God. He wouldn't have planted the seed of coding in my heart if He didn‚Äôt want me to water it and watch it grow into a beautiful flower that brings warmth and healing to others. üå∏</p>
